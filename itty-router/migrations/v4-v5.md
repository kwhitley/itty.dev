### Migrations
# <u>Migration Guides ></u> v4 to v5 <u>- itty-router</u>

v5 is a major step forward in terms of robustness, power, and *slimness*.  Here's a quick rundown of all changes:

## Changes in v5
- <Badge type="danger" text="breaking" /> `router.fetch` replaces `router.handle` to enable cleaner exports.
- <Badge type="danger" text="breaking" /> `createCors()` has been replaced with the improved [`cors()`](/itty-router/cors).
- <Badge type="danger" text="breaking" /> `RouteHandler` (type) has been replaced with [`RequestHandler`](/itty-router/typescript/api#requesthandler).
- <Badge type="warning" text="change" /> previous `Router` is now preserved as [`IttyRouter`](/itty-router/routers/ittyrouter).
- <Badge type="warning" text="added" /> new [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router) (backwards-compatible) adds support for stages.
- <Badge type="warning" text="added" /> new batteries-included [`AutoRouter`](/itty-router/routers/autorouter) adds default settings to [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router).
- <Badge type="warning" text="change" /> TypeScript support has been improved in all of the routers, allowing router-level generics **AND** route-level generic overrides in the same router.

## 1. `router.handle` is deprecated in favor of `router.fetch`
At some point in v4, we began to support (at the cost of extra bytes) boththe original `router.handle` and the newer `router.fetch`, which matches the default export signature of Cloudflare Workers and Bun.  Using `router.fetch` allows you to simply export the router, allowing its internal `.fetch` method to match up to what the runtime expects.

To save bytes, we're dropping support for `router.handle`, preferring `router.fetch` in all cases.

```ts
export default {
  fetch: router.handle, // [!code --] // previously
  fetch: router.fetch, // [!code ++]
}

// or simply
export default { ...router } // [!code ++]
```

## 2. CORS: [`cors()`](/itty-router/cors) replaces previous `createCors()`
This was a big one.  As some folks have found, the previous CORS solution included a nasty race condition that could affect high-throughput APIs using CORS.  The solution required a breaking change anyway, so we ripped off the bandage and rewrote the entire thing.  By changing the name as well, we're intentionally drawing attention that things have changed.  While this is a non-trivial migration compared to the others, it comes with a series of advantages:

- It now supports the complete options that express.js does, including support for various formats (e.g. string, array of string, RegExp, etc).  We have embraced the industry-standard naming (this is a change).
- It correctly handles the previously-identified race condition
- It correctly handles some other edge-cases not previously addressed
- It handles far-more-complex origin cases & reflection than the previous version
- *We added all this extra power while shaving off 100 bytes.* :fire::fire::fire:

```ts [IttyRouter / manual]
import { Router, json, error,
  createCors, // [!code --]
  cors, // [!code ++]
} from 'itty-router'

const router = Router()
const { preflight, corsify } = createCors() // [!code --]
const { preflight, corsify } = cors() // [!code ++]

router.get('/', () => 'Success!')

export default {
  fetch: (request, ...args) =>
    router
      .fetch(request, ...args)
      .then(json)
      .catch(error)
      .then(corsify) // [!code --]
      .then((req, res) => corsify(req, res)) // [!code ++]
}
```

```ts [AutoRouter / stages]
import { AutoRouter, cors } from 'itty-router' // [!code ++]

const { preflight, corsify } = cors() // [!code ++]

const router = AutoRouter({
  before: [preflight], // [!code ++] // add preflight to upstream middleware
  finally: [corsify], // [!code ++] // and corsify to response handlers
})

router.get('/', () => 'Success!')

export default { ...router }
```

## 3. The Three Routers

v5 preserves the original `Router` as [`IttyRouter`](/itty-router/routers/ittyrouter), and introduces two advanced routers, [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router) and [`AutoRouter`](/itty-router/routers/autorouter). [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router) is a 100% backwards-compatible swap, with perfect feature-parity with the previous Router.

Here are the key changes:

### Added functionality to standard [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router)
- Added: `before` stage - an array of handlers that processes before route-matching
- Added: `catch` - a handler that will catch any thrown error.  Errors thrown during the `finally` stage will naturally not be subject to the `finally` handlers (preventing it from throwing infinitely).
- Added: `finally` stage - an array of handlers that processes after route-matching, and after any error thrown during the `before` stage or route-matching.

#### Example
```ts
import { Router, error, json, withParams } from 'itty-router'

const router = Router({
  before: [withParams], // [!code ++]
  catch: error, // [!code ++]
  finally: [json], // [!code ++]
})

router
  .get('/params/:id', ({ id }) => `Your id is ${id}.`) // withParams already included
  .get('/json', () => [1,2,3]) // auto-formatted as JSON
  .get('/throw', (a) => a.b.c) // safely returns a 500

export default { ...router } // CF Workers or Bun
```

### Added [`AutoRouter`](/itty-router/routers/autorouter)
This is a thin wrapper around [`Router`](/itty-router/routers/router), with a few default behaviors included, and a couple additional options for fine-tuned control.

- [`withParams`](/itty-router/api#withparams) is included by default before the `before` stage, allowing direct access of route params from the request itself.
- [`json`](/itty-router/api#json) response formatter is included by default before the `finally` stage, formatting any unformatted responses as JSON.
- A default 404 is included for missed routes.  This is equivalent to `router.all('*', () => error(404)`, and may be changed using the `missing` option (below).
- Added `missing` option to replace the default 404.  Example `{ missing: error(404, 'Are you sure about that?') }`. To prevent any 404, include a `() => {}` no-op here.
- Added `format` option to replace the default formatter of [`json`](/itty-router/api#json).  To prevent all formatting, include a `() => {}` no-op here.

#### Example
```ts
import { AutoRouter } from 'itty-router' // [!code ++]

const router = AutoRouter() // [!code ++]

router
  .get('/params/:id', ({ id }) => `Your id is ${id}.`) // withParams already included
  .get('/json', () => [1,2,3]) // auto-formatted as JSON
  .get('/throw', (a) => a.b.c) // safely returns a 500

export default { ...router } // CF Workers or Bun
```

#### Bigger Example
```js
import { AutoRouter, error } from 'itty-router'

// upstream middleware to embed a start time
const withBenchmarking = (request) => {
  request.start = Date.now()
}

// downstream handler to log it all out
const logger = (res, req) => {
  console.log(res.status, req.url, Date.now() - req.start,  'ms')
}

// now let's create the router
const router = AutoRouter({
  port: 3001, // [!code ++]
  before: [withBenchmarking], // [!code ++]
  missing: () => error(404, 'Custom 404 message.'), // [!code ++]
  finally: [logger], // [!code ++]
})

router.get('/', () => 'Success!')

export default { ...router } // Bun server on port 3001
```

## 4. TypeScript Changes
We've kept things mostly in place from the last round on this, with some improvements, and one minor (technically breaking) change.

### Improved router/route generics
We've added the ability to include router-level generics AND route-level generics in the same router.  Before, this was not possible, forcing users to pick one or the other.

```ts
import { IRequestStrict, Router } from 'itty-router'

type FooRequest = {
  foo: string
} & IRequestStrict

type BarRequest = {
  bar: string
} & IRequestStrict

const router = Router<FooRequest>() // [!code ++] // router-level generic

router
  .get('/', (request) => {
    request.foo // foo is valid
    request.bar // [!code error] // but bar is not
  })

  // use a route-level generic to override the router-level one
  .get<BarRequest>('/', (request) => { // [!code ++] // route-level override
    request.foo // [!code error] // now foo is not valid
    request.bar // but bar is
  })
```

### Previous `RouteHandler` becomes [`RequestHandler`](/itty-router/typescript/api#requesthandler) <badge type="danger" text="breaking" />
Technically, no one should be affected by this, as `RouteHandler` was not a documented/advertised type (but rather used internally).  Nevertheless, as it was an exported type, we're drawing attention to the change.

To make things more explicit, we've renamed `RouteHandler` to the more correct [`RequestHandler`](/itty-router/typescript/api#requesthandler).  While originally only used in route-definitions, this type is actually the foundation of all handlers/middleware, and thus needed a more appropriate name before people started using it externally.

```ts
import { RequestHandler } from 'itty-router' // [!code ++]

export const withUser: RequestHandler = (request) => { // [!code ++]
  request.user = 'Kevin'
}
```
